# Bike Sharing Demand Prediction

## Overview
This project analyzes the Bike Sharing Demand dataset to predict the total count of bikes rented during each hour. The analysis involves extensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Feature Engineering, and Model Training using various regression techniques including Linear Regression, Lasso, Ridge, and XGBoost.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of hourly rental data spanning two years.
- `train.csv`: Training set comprising the first 19 days of each month.
- `test.csv`: Test set comprising the remaining days of the month.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn
- xgboost

## Usage
1. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Run the notebook: `jupyter notebook Bike_Sharing_Demand_Analysis.ipynb`
